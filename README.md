Anita MK3 is a bigger metallic version of Anita MK2. Designed for practical use, it is fit with two 12 Volt CIM Motors, an Nvidia Jetson Nano, two LED floodlights, and a LIPO Battery Pack. 

I initially started this project three years ago and I am quite amazed with how far I've come. Going from small 3D printed parts, to cutting out giant sheets of aluminum has been fufilling and fun. The idea of being able to help out people during natural disasters, and have a robot people can learn from has been the idealogies that have driven me to continue development of this robot.
